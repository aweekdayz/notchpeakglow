# Changelog

## 1.6.1 — Unreleased (Build 38)

- English interface, diagnostic logs, source comments and current documentation.
- Explicit arm64 build target, English bundle language and hardened runtime.
- Full Xcode resource-build and packaging script with SDK, shader, layered-icon, signature and checksum validation.
- Built-in notch selection with positive geometry checks; no glow on external displays.
- Physical-size Pro detection independent of scaled resolution; unknown models retain a generic fallback.
- Stop rendering when the notch display disappears or sleeps; refresh EDR headroom after repositioning.
- Dismiss controls when display geometry changes or the notch display disconnects.
- Bounded SMC reconnection attempts, validated thermal response metadata and cached temperature-key metadata.
- Clear stale automatic load and temperature alerts when readings become unavailable; accept a valid zero-watt reading.
- Clear persisted temperature alerts at startup and provide an accessible Settings fallback without a notch display.
- Match the alert-brightness control to the shader's actual 0.5–2× multiplier range.
- Document family presets, unverified hardware coverage, current build limitations and unresolved upstream licensing.

No new release binary has been published for these changes. The current shader compiles with the installed Metal Toolchain. The full resource build remains blocked by layered-icon export.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-10-12

- Native macOS 27 Liquid Glass controls and English Settings.
- Soft low-load glow, ice-blue Boost and warm temperature alerts.
- Native Glow selector with Auto, Off, Soft, Boost and Warm previews.
- Refined notch hover presentation, consistent focused appearance and automatic pointer dismissal.
- Direct Quit button and a single Settings entry in the controls panel.
- Improved Settings grouping, explanatory text and numeric-field layout.
- Reduced power-sampling and rendering overhead; transparent final fade-out frames.
- Requires macOS 27 or later and Apple Silicon. Build 37.

Distribution uses ad-hoc signing and is not Apple-notarized.
